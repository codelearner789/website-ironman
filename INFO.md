## Credits
I have always been inspired by the character Iron Man from Marvel and I felt like my admiration for this comic book character 
is what inspired me to create a portfolio page on him.

## Takeaway
I felt like doing this project really helped me to cement my knowledge and understanding of CSS design in web programming. I also feel like my understanding of HTML/CSS
in general has become more reinforced and I have gained more confidence in being able to design more complicated websites.

## Future work
If I had more time, I would have dedicated to creating more sections in my website to create a more detailed portfolio report on my person for whom I dedicated this portfolio to.
I would have also spent time creating a dedicated video section for my website as fell as experienced with flexbox more than I actually did.
