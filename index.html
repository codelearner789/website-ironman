  This is the index.html page I am making for the first official homework assignment for this
  class. For this project, I decided to make a portfolio page on one of my favorite superheroes
  Iron Man because I am not very comfortable with making a portfolio page on myself and having
  it be shared on the UW student servers

          <h2>Traits of Tony Stark aka Iron Man</h2>

          <h3>Personality</h3>
          <p>
            Tony Stark is someone who is often characterized as being arrogant and selfish. Due
            to his immense wealth and success, he often likes to see himself as the center of the
            universe. He is also quite stubborn and often likes to ignore the advice of others
            and usually just likes to stick with his own methods. However, after getting
            captured by terrorists in Afghanistan on a business trip and building a mechanized
            suit of armor to escape, he has slowly underwent a huge transformation in his
            personality. Although he still remains arrogant and is pretentious at times, he has
            shown a willingness to commit good deeds and sacrifice himself when needed. A famous
            example is when he risked his life to redirect the course of a nuclear missile fired
            at New York to save the city from annihilation and end the alien invasion in New
            York.
          </p>
          <h3>Abilities</h3>
          <h4>As the Armored Superhero Iron Man</h4>
          <p>
            As Iron Man, Stark wears an electromechanical suit that gives him immense superhuman
            strength as well as an arsenal of weapons and equipment to aid him in his missions.
            His suit is also capable of flying at supersonic speeds as well as letting the user
            use the built in computer to analyze the suit's surroundings. Furthermore, the suit
            is essentially armed to the teeth with powerful repulsor blasters, missiles, and
            lasers.
          </p>
          <h4>Capabilities without his suit</h4>
          <p>
            Despite the strengths and immense capabilities, that the Iron Man suit offers, Tony
            Stark is much more than just the suit of armor he wears. He is gifted with an
            extremely brillant mind who graduated at the top of his class from the M.I.T at the
            tender age of 17. Some of his intellectual feats include building his first circuit
            board at age 4 and his own car engine at the age of six. His later feats include
            building a cold-fusion based arc reactor and his first iron man suit in a cave
            with limited resources as well as building an extremely sophisticated
            Artificial Intelligence system, Jarvis, from scratch.

          <h2>People affiliated with Iron Man</h2>
          <p>
            Like every other superhero from any universe, Iron Man is bound to obviously have many
            formidible foes who have proven themselves to be a headache for the genius-superhero
            inventor. Despite the extremely cutting edge nature of his suit of armor and an immense
            IQ, he still needs reliable allies and friends to help him combat evil.
